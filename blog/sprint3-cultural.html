            The relationship between EQ and IQ

          <h5>What is EQ?</h5>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (EQ) refers to a certain group of skills and talents relating
            to emotional awareness and social skills. It aims to measure a person's ability to
            recognise emotions in themselves and others, and use that information effectively.
            It is generally considered to cover:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-awareness – recognising what emotions you're experiencing and how they're
              affecting your actions and perception.</li>
            <li>Self-regulation – managing how your emotions influence your external actions.</li>
            <li>Motivation – maintaining personal focus and drive, resilience.</li>
            <li>Empathy – the ability to imagine how other people are feeling and how their experience
              differs from your own.</li>
            <li>Social skills – communication and developing relationships.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>EQ vs. IQ</h5>
          <p>
            IQ can sometimes be referred to as a measure of “intelligence”, but is, more accurately, measuring a
            few specific types of intelligence:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
            <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
            <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No doubt, these are all important and useful skills to have! But this is hardly an exhaustive list of human
            talent,
            skill and potential. Most of us have met enough people with varying talents to see
            that many other aspects contribute to success, achievement and creativity.
          </p>
          <h5>The value of EQ</h5>
          <p>
            The importance of EQ is, I think, quite clear when you look at what most people actually do
            in a work day. Almost everyone has to work with others – what is a company if not people
            working together? So being able to communicate, empathise and self-regulate is key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, it is difficult to perform at your best if you aren’t aware
            of your own emotional state. Being able to identify and manage your response to
            emotions will put you in the best position to carry out all those
            other IQ-related tasks, no matter what circumstances come your way.
