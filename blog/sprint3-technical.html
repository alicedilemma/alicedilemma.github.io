          <h5>HTML and CSS</h5>
          <p>
            HTML and CSS are two different coding languages that we use together to make a website. 
            HTML defines the structure and CSS defines the styling. Like if we were building a house, 
            we might say the house should have 2 bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. 
            That’s our HTML. Then we might say, every bedroom should have yellow walls, the kitchen 
            should be 5m by 3m, the bathroom should have a white floor. 
            That's to do with the appearance, and would be the CSS.
          </p>
          <h5>Control flow and loops</h5>
          <p>
            Control flow is the order in which things happen in your code. Generally in JavaScript 
            the code is run line by line, from the first line through to the last line. 
            However, you can use 
            certain structures to change the flow of your code and make it respond to different things.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, a conditional. This is a piece of code that asks a question and responds 
            differently depending on the answer. For example, I might say to you:
          </p>
          <code>
            I want you to go to the supermarket. If they have bananas, then buy me a banana. 
            Otherwise, buy me an apple.
          </code>
          <p>
            If I wanted to ask the computer to do that for me in JavaScript, I could structure my question 
            like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code>if (there are bananas at the supermarket) {
  buy me a banana;
} else {
  buy me an apple;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            The code checks whether something is true, in this case whether there are bananas, and runs 
            a different bit of code depending on the answer.
          </p>
            Another example is a loop, which lets you do something repeatedly while certain conditions are true.
            For example, let’s say you’re drinking a coffee. You get given the coffee, 
            you take a sip. Now you’ve drank some of the coffee, but there’s still some left, 
            so you take another sip. You want to keep repeating that action of 'taking a sip' until there is 
            no coffee left.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a computer, I could write this process with a <strong>while loop</strong>:
          </p>
          <pre><code>while (there is coffee left) {
  take a sip;
  }
  put mug in dishwasher;</code></pre>
          <p>
            The <strong>take a sip</strong> part of the code will run again and again while there is still coffee left. 
            When there is no coffee left the code will move onto the next step, putting your mug in the dishwasher.
          </p>
          <h5>The DOM</h5>
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is the browser's interpretation of the HTML code that makes up your website.
            It represents the page and acts as an interface, so you can use programs to interact with the page's structure, 
            style and content.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DOM is not specific to a particular programming language, but it can be used to let JavaScript 
            interact with your website. It interprets a document (the web page) using a hierarchical structure 
            of nodes and objects. This creates a model that your JavaScript can interact with.
          </p>
          <p>
            The root of the hierarchy is the <strong>window object</strong>. This level is used for 
            anything you might want to control to do with the container that your web page is displayed in. 
            For instance accessing the current URL, or fiddling with the scrollbar.
          </p>
          <p>    
            Next is the <strong>document object</strong>. This gives access to all the HTML elements on your 
            page and what gets shown. But it isn't read-only, you can also manipulate the document. For example, 
            using JavaScript to add an element to your page. It can also listen and react to events, like a 
            user clicking on something.    
          </p>
          <h5>Arrays vs. objects</h5>
          <p>
            An array is a list – like a shopping list. It has different things on the list, in order.
            To access a piece of information you can say where it lives on the list. 
            I could ask the computer to <strong>give me the 3rd item on the shopping list array</strong> 
            and the computer will look at the list, find the third item, and tell me what it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            An object is like a filing cabinet. Each drawer has a label and a piece of information inside. 
            For example, I could have a filing cabinet for all my personal information. I might have a drawer 
            with my birthday, a drawer with my IRD number and a drawer with my phone number. To get a piece  
            of information from the filing cabinet, I say to the computer <strong>look in my Alice  
            object and find the drawer labelled birthday</strong>. The computer would then 
            go to that object, find the right label and give me the piece of information stored there.
          </p>
          <h5>Functions</h5>
          <p>
            A function is a set of instructions that you group together so you can use them again 
            and again. When you give a computer instructions, through code, you have to break 
            things down into very simple steps. For example, if I wanted my computer to 
            make a cup of tea I might give it some instructions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Fill the kettle with water</li>
            <li>Turn on the kettle</li>
            <li>Get a cup</li>
            <li>Put a teabag in the cup</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            But if I wanted to have a cup of tea every morning, I wouldn't want to have to keep telling 
            the computer all these instructions. So what I do is give that set of instructions a name, 
            like 'make cup of tea', that refers to all the steps involved with making a cup of tea. 
            Now I can just say to the computer <strong>make cup of tea</strong> and the computer 
            can go back at look at that function and see all the steps required to make my tea.
