          <h5>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h5>
          <p>
            I got blocked while writing one of the functions for the Built-in Methods kata. 
            The function takes an array of objects, each object contains a door and a person hiding 
            behind that door. It uses the find() method to return the first door it finds that has 
            Scooby Doo hiding behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The find() method was something I hadn’t used before, so my first problem solving steps  
            were google and giving it a try. I found an example and wrote the function how I thought it 
            should go, but it didn't work.
          </p>
            I wasn’t sure whether I was using find() incorrectly of if I had other issues in my code, 
            so at this stage I started using console.log() at various points in my function 
            to track my variables. This helped me find two errors:
          <ol>
            <li>In my if statement I was using a single = instead of checking equality with ===</li>
            <li>I had gotten confused about what layer of object I was in, which is why I kept getting 
              undefined instead of an actual door value</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Now I was pretty confident I had fixed the other mistakes I went back to my reduce() method, 
            took another look at google, and got it working.
          </p>
          <p>
            This instance of getting stuck happened after I had continued working when I knew I needed to 
            take a break. I remember thinking before that kata that I should stop for a while, but then 
            getting sucked into doing just a little bit more. I think that contributed to having so 
            many different little problems that I didn’t see straight away. This is a good reminder for 
            myself, I can easily get sucked into fun challenges and find it hard to give my brain some time off. 
            I think that if I had gone outside for a few minutes and come back to this block I would have 
            solved it much quicker.
          </p>
          <h5>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
          <p>
            I felt that I solved the FizzBuzz kata very effectively. The kata involved creating a 
            function that took an array, followed a set of rules to transform some of the numbers into words, 
            and returned the new array.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first used pseudocode to list out the steps, which resulted in a clear blueprint for writing 
            the function. From that I was able to see the problem very clearly and managed to write it no problem, 
            with only slight improvements from my pseudocode steps to my actual code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt calm and focused throughout the process. I think if that kata’s instructions hadn’t specifically 
            asked me to use pseudocode, I wouldn’t have – I had a pretty good idea already of how the function 
            would run and would have jumped straight to writing it. But taking the time to write out the pseudocode 
            first made the problem-solving process run very smoothly. I suspect if I hadn’t taken that step 
            I would have had more small mistakes crop up and generally have worked slower.
          </p>
          <h5>Problem solving techniques</h5>
          <p>
            My confidence with the following problem solving techniques and processes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode – I like using this a lot, it helps keep my thoughts ordered.</li>
            <li>Trying something – this strategy is generally my default go-to.</li>
            <li>Rubber ducking – I am practising this!</li>
            <li>Reading error messages – this is something I’m improving at. I wound’t say I’m fluent yet, 
              but I’m getting better at interpreting them.</li>
            <li>Console.logging – I use this a lot, especially when things break.</li>
            <li>Googling – Pretty confident, but I'm still improving at finding the relevant information 
              efficiently.</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help – I haven’t practised this yet in this course, but I like 
              talking things through with others. Especially getting a fresh set of eyes on something 
              when you’ve been staring at it for too long.</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help – same as above.</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection – this isn't something I had done formally before, 
              but I’m finding the Foundations reflections very effective in helping me understand my 
              own processes.</li>
          </ul>
