          <h3 class="subtitle is-4">Reflecting on Foundation Core Skills</h3>
          <h4 class="subtitle">February 2019</h4>
          <p>
            For me, a lot of the core learning was about re-examining my relationship 
            to learning. I haven’t been a full-time student for quite a few years and I 
            found the core learning sections really helpful in processing what studying 
            means to me at this stage of life.
          </p>
          <h5>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>I’ve changed a lot since the last time I was a full-time student.</li>
            <li>I can be proactive in structuring my learning so that it suits my learning style, rather than just
              suffering through something I find super boring.</li>
            <li>Reaching a focused work state can be practised and it’s a super satisfying habit to build.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
          <p>
            The most surprising thing has been how specific I’ve been able to get when 
            assessing myself. For instance, in my weekly check-ins, I’ve noticed that 
            I’m able to really clearly articulate why I’m enjoying or not enjoying certain 
            parts of the course. I think that without completing the reflections I would 
            have known which parts were not working for me, but after completing them, I 
            can go beyond that and understand why and how to fix it.
          </p>
          <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
          <p>
            The most challenging aspect was just doing so much writing. Constant 
            reflection is tiring, it requires quite deep thinking. But I found 
            myself get faster at it as the course progressed.
          </p>
          <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
            development bootcamp course?</h5>
          <p>
            I think that EDA has put this focus on core learning because sometimes tech 
            is mis-represented as a career which isn’t people-focused. But in reality, 
            it’s very people focused and to create great work environments you want 
            employees with great people skills.
          </p>
          <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
            that time to practicing programming instead?</h5>
          <p>
            It didn’t feel like a waste of time. I still did plenty of coding practice! 
            I think that, especially with the topics related to examining my own learning, 
            time put in at the beginning will pay off in more efficient learning 
            throughout my entire career.
