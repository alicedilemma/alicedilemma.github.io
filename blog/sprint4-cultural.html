          <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to change and adapt throughout a person’s life. Every time
            we have a thought or learn something new we strengthen a neural pathway in our brain. These small
            changes can add up over time to significant brain rewiring.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "Neurons that fire together wire together."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Understanding that your brain is always changing and can be developed is hugely beneficial to anyone
            learning something new! If you believe that your brain is fixed, it’s hard to imagine coming to
            understand or master anything that you find difficult. You may believe that you’re just not talented at
            something and that’s the end of the story. But when you realise that connections in the brain are
            strengthened by repetition and experience, you can see that we always have the potential to improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity highlights the importance of practice. To master something you have to put the time in
            and revisit it often. You can use that understanding to inform your own approach to
            learning. Make sure you're revisiting things through review, and practicing skills and thought
            patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            It does get harder to form new pathways as you get older, but you can take steps to help yourself
            continue to learn and change. Much like a muscle, the brain needs to be used to keep it strong. Continue
            to challenge yourself and put yourself in new learning experiences to help keep your brain malleable.
            You can also support your brain by maintaining your general physical health.

          <h5>Growth Mindset</h5>
          <p>
            Having a Growth Mindset is understanding that your abilities can be developed through effort and
            persistence. Rather than believing your abilities are fixed (a ‘fixed mindset’) you know that you
            always have the capability to grow and improve. Perhaps not everyone can reach the same level of
            ability, but everyone is capable of improving beyond their current level.
          </p>
          <p>
            In researching a Growth Mindset I came across the idea of possessing a Growth Mindset in some
            aspects of your life but not others. I think this is an interesting point - although we may be great at
            learning new thing in some aspects of our lives, there are often other ideas that we hold about
            ourselves without examining too closely. I think it’s valuable to examine our mindset in all aspects 
            of our lives, not just those directly related to education.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m trying to integrate this way of thinking this into my time at EDA by focusing on
            consistent effort and growth rather than results. If I put time and focus into my learning 
            then I will consider that a success. There are many external factors out of my control, but my
            effort is something that I can control.

          <h5>My learning plan</h5>
          <p>
            After researching neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset I am updating my learning plan to include a
            focus on practice. I’ve added a new goal:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Practise JavaScript 6 days a week – by continuing with a project I’m working on or 
              completing a kata.</li>
            </ul>
